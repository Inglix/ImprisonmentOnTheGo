# Imprisonment On The Go! (Continued)
This is a continuation of [Imprisonment On The Go! (Make Pawns Prisoners Without Beds)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/1203903378) originally created by [AgentBlac](https://steamcommunity.com/id/agentblac).

## Description
This mod makes it possible to capture downed pawns as prisoners without the need to have a securely enclosed prisoner bed on the same map. Such prisoners are shackled and slow-moving, but could still make an attempt to escape if not secured by the time they regain their mobility.

## Features
When you have downed an enemy pawn, simply select one of your colonists, then right click the downed enemy and select the _Imprison_ option from the float menu. It's as simple as that.

## Compatibility
### [Locks](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/1157085076)
This mod must be loaded after the Locks mod.
